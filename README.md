## Hyperledger Private Data Objects (Intel)
- [git@github.com:xwang98/confidential-computing-collections.git](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/private-data-objects)
- Private Data Objects (PDO) enables sharing of data and coordinating action amongst mutually distrusting parties. Interaction is mediated through a “smart contract” that defines data access and update policies that are carried with the object regardless of where it resides or how often it changes hands. The smart contracts policies are enforced through execution in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).

## Veracruz (ARM)
- https://github.com/veracruz-project/veracruz
- Veracruz is a research project exploring how secure distributed systems can be built using strong containerisation technology and remote attestation protocols. Here, "strong containerisation" is an idiosyncratic term that we use for any technology that exists on a continuum between pure hardware secure enclaves to high-assurance hypervisor-based isolation. The common factor in all "strong containerisation" technologies is that they successfully isolate code within a container — providing strong confidentiality and integrity guarantees, even against privileged software co-tenanted on the same machine — whilst attempting to significantly minimise the trusted compute base.


## Hyperledger Avalon (Intel)
- https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon
- Hyperledger Avalon (formerly Trusted Compute Framework) enables privacy in blockchain transactions, moving intensive processing from a main blockchain to improve scalability and latency, and to support attested Oracles.

## Enarx (Redhat)
- https://github.com/enarx/enarx
- Enarx is an application deployment system enabling applications to run within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) without rewriting for particular platforms or SDKs. It handles attestation and delivery into a run-time “Keep” based on WebAssembly, offering developers a wide range of language choices for implementation. Enarx is CPU-architecture independent, enabling the same application code to be deployed across multiple targets, abstracting issues such as cross-compilation and differing attestation mechanisms between hardware vendors. Work is currently underway on AMD SEV and Intel SGX.

## Teaclave (Baidu)
- https://github.com/apache/incubator-teaclave
- Apache Teaclave (incubating) is an open source universal secure computing platform, making computation on privacy-sensitive data safe and simple.

## Inclavare (Alibaba)
- https://github.com/alibaba/inclavare-containers
- Inclavare Containers is an innovation of container runtime with the novel approach for launching protected containers in hardware-assisted Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology, aka Enclave, which can prevent the untrusted entity, such as Cloud Service Provider (CSP), from accessing the sensitive and confidential assets in use.

## KubeTEE (Ant)
- https://github.com/SOFAEnclave/KubeTEE
- KubeTEE is a collection of TEE development, deployment, maintenance middleware frameworks, and services. Especially, it is for cloud-native workflows. As the name implies, KubeTEE is based on the docker containers, Kubernetes orchestration, and other cloud-native technologies. Its goal is to help developers to implement TEE-based applications and deploy TEE services more easily and smoothly.

## Open Enclave (Microsoft)
- https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave
- The Open Enclave SDK is a hardware-agnostic open source library for developing applications that utilize Hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments, also known as Enclaves.

## The Confidential Consortium Framework (Microsoft)
- https://github.com/Microsoft/CCF
- The Confidential Consortium Framework (CCF) is an open-source framework for building a new category of secure, highly available, and performant applications that focus on multi-party compute and data. CCF can enable high-scale, confidential networks that meet key enterprise requirements — providing a means to accelerate production and enterprise adoption of consortium based blockchain and multi-party compute technology.
